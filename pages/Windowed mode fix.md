Fix games running only in windowed mode:
Use Fullscreenizer: https://github.com/KasumiL5x/Fullscreenizer

In Windows go to Settings > Display Settings > Graphics Settings > Change default graphics settings.

Enable optimization for windowed games. This will allow the fake fullscreen of Fullscreenizer to run with real fullscreen performance.
