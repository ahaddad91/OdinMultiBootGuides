Other tweaks

You can use winutil to debloat windows after installation, but I recommend using only the "tweaks" tab, don't use it to install softwares or to mess with windows update: https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/winutil

Do not install Borderless Gaming as it seems to corrupt Windows installation.

Do not try to remove Test Mode watermark using "Bcdedit.exe -set TESTSIGNING OFF" it will cause boot error

Do not try to remove Test Mode watermark with 3rd party tools, some are flagged with virus, others cause boot error / system corruption

You can use dControl to disable Windows Defender to squeeze a little bit more of performance:

DO AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!! You have to disable Windows Defender real time protection before downloading dControl

And you are good to go.
